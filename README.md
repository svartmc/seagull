Procedural animation of a low poly seagull using <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three.js.</a>

She flies until she reaches the top of the buoy, then goes into a “sit” state which starts the animation.
Using a raycaster, the buoy is moved at the mouse position, taking the seagull off.
